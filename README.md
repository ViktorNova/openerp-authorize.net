Straightforward credit card processing for OpenERP via Authorize.net API, that actually works

Currently works great for OpenERP 7!

This was cloned from Brett Lehr's code here: https://code.launchpad.net/~brett-lehrer

After a long time of searching, trying various modules, and failing, this is the first and only way I have ever managed to implement credit card processing into OpenERP, so I copied it into my own repo here for safe keeping
